## boombox
once the below dependencies are installed, clone the repo and run main.py. the script runs a server (UDP by default, although it's possible to change this by passing ```socket_type='tcp'``` when constructing the ReceiveAndPlay class) in a serve_forever loop listening for messages formatted as 'trackname/volume'. track name corresponds to a key in the Boombox tracks dictionary, whose value is the path to the track. volume is a float between 0.0 - 1.0. all other messages are ignored

sound files should be placed in the sound/ dir within the repo's directory. you'll have to make sound/ yourself as it is currently in the .gitignore.
